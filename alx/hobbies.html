    <h2>My Journaling Routine  </h2>    
    <p>I dedicate time each evening to write in my journal. I usually start by jotting down the events of the day, followed by my thoughts and emotions related to those events. This routine not only helps me unwind but also provides clarity and perspective on various aspects of my life.</p>
